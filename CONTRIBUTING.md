# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We appreciate your help and support in making this repository better. The following guidelines will help you get started with contributing.

## Naming Convention

- The programs in the folders `Sem-1`, `Sem-2`, and `Sem-3` should be named according to the purpose of the program, e.g. `CyclicDetection.c`.

- In the `Sem-4` folder, the folders should be named using alphabets (A, B, C, D, etc.) to represent the sections in the university.

- The files inside each folder of `Sem-4` should be named in the format `Ticking-Session-[Session Number]([A, B, C, D])`. The `[Session Number]` should be the ticking session number (1, 2, or 3 etc.) for that particular session, and in the brackets, A represents the first program of that ticking session, B represents the 2nd program of that ticking session, etc.

## Creating a Branch

- Before making any changes, it is recommended to create a new branch for your changes. This allows you to keep your changes separate from the main code, making it easier to review and merge.

- To create a new branch, navigate to the repository in GitHub and click the "Branch: master" dropdown. Enter a name for your branch, and click "Create branch".

## Making Commits

- Make sure to keep your changes organized by committing often and with descriptive messages.

- Commit messages should briefly describe the changes you have made and the reasons behind them.

## Creating an Issue

- Give your issue a descriptive title and provide a clear and concise description of the problem you are trying to solve.

## Creating a Pull Request

- Once you have made your changes and committed them, you can create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main code.

- To create a PR, navigate to your branch in the repository and click the "Compare & pull request" button.
