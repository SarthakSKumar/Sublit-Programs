## Naming Convention

- The programs in the folders `Sem-1`, `Sem-2`, and `Sem-3` should be named according to the purpose of the program, e.g. `CyclicDetection.c`.

- In the `Sem-4` folder, the folders should be named using alphabets (Sec-A, Sec-B, Sec-C, Sec-D, etc.) to represent the sections.

- The files inside each folder of `Sem-4` should be named in the format `Ticking-Session-[Session Number]([A, B, C, D])`.
  - The `[Session Number]` should be the ticking session number (1, 2, or 3 etc.) for that particular session, and in the brackets, A represents the first program of that ticking session, B represents the 2nd program of that ticking session, etc.
